# Personal-Finance-Excel-Tracker
This is an excel macro-enabled workbook I created to track my personal finances and investments

I have created this workbook last month to start tracking my spending and also my investment performance. There are more sheets hidden on this workbook
however the ones visible are all that are required to run the workbook.

The overview page has a refresh button to refresh investment values and the save daily values button updates the total value and profit graphs on the overview page.
It does this as the values are entered onto another page using a VBA script I made, and then the graph updates using a custom range that tracks the columns with values on the 
working tracker sheet that is hidden.

The salary and spend sheet has a userform for tracking expenses, while the saving_invest forecaster is a sheet that assists with forecasting balances on accounts and 
assists with tracking these expenses.

The personal investment page is the 2nd main page as it shows holding breakdowns and P/L percentages for each individual holding. The values here are dummy values which can be removed on the US transactions page. There are more userforms for entering in trades completed.

The US portfolio page just shows some more in-depth information, and the AUS margin portfolio page shows in-depth detail about the loan on the account and LVR ratings etc.
